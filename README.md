In the **passive** reconnaissance stage of a penetration test, this script is used when I'm not ready to scan the target directly but still want to determine which ports are open.

The script reads IP addresses from a file, displays detailed information about each one, separates the results for each IP address with an empty line, and writes the results to a CSV file.
